# The 'files' section is a mapping between the path of the file relative to
# the repository root and its location in the filesystem (where the program
# expects it)
# In this case, say your repository is at `~/.dotfiles`, it will map
# `~/.dotfiles/zsh/zprofile` to `~/.zprofile`,
# and `~/.dotfiles/zshrc` to `~/.zshrc`
# To clarify, folders in the repository don't have to correspond to packages.
# On Windows, '~' is expanded to 'C:\Users\<USERNAME>\'

# The 'variables' section contains constants that the templated files
# can access. This section can contain all the types that toml supports,
