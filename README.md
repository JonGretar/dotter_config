# Dotfiles with Dotter

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) managed with [Dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter). Dotter is a dotfile manager and templating engine that helps to organize, version control, and deploy configuration files across different machines.

## What is Dotter?

Dotter is a dotfile manager written in Rust that uses the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templating engine. It allows you to:

1. Organize your configuration files in a single repository
2. Use templates with variables for different environments
3. Easily deploy your dotfiles to the correct locations
4. Maintain machine-specific configurations separately from shared ones
